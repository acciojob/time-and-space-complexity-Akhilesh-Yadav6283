	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science and algorithm analysis, measuring the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the amount of time it takes to execute as a function of its input size. Achieving efficient time complexity is a paramount goal when designing algorithms, as it directly impacts the performance of software systems. </p>
    <p><b>Space complexity</b>, often referred to as "<b>Space complexity</b>," is another crucial aspect of algorithm analysis, complementing the assessment of time efficiency. It evaluates the amount of memory or storage space required by an algorithm as it processes data, typically in relation to the input size.<b>Space complexity</b> is denoted using big O notation (O(n)), where 'n' represents the size of the input.</p>
